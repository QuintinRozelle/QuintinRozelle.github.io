## Enhancement One
### Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact chosen for enhancement one is the binary search tree (BST) assignment from CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms. This is a quick program that will load a CSV file into memory as a BST and perform basic insertion, search, deletion, and traversal operations on it. It was originally meant as an assignment to gain experience working with BST. I chose to use this one for enhancement one specifically for a few different reasons:
1.	I wanted to convert something from one language to another for this artifact. Upon thinking about this, I decided to convert something into Python because it has been a while since I used Python to any significant degree and this enhancement provided me with the opportunity to brush up on my Python skills. Additionally, if I do go into something involving big data, I will need to be proficient in Python.
2.	In addition to brushing up on Python, I also wanted to take the opportunity in this class to gain more experience with data structures and algorithms (DSA) since it has been a while since I specifically reviewed/studied those. While enhancement two does cover this, using something related to DSA during another enhancement would give me additional experience.
3.	Upon reviewing artifacts that fit the above goals, I realized that there were many areas that I could improve this one specifically. This gives me the chance to showcase what I have learned through this degree since I originally created the original code.

### Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
As stated above, this artifact fits the requirements I was looking for in this enhancement (i.e., conversion to Python, DSA, and opportunities to improve). Further, in planning the additional enhancements, I realized that I could use this for all three which gives me the opportunity to show how I can take code and improve it over time to produce a polished deliverable for a client.

While reviewing the original code, I discovered some significant areas of improvement. These include exception handling, input validation, and better documentation, in addition to converting it to Python. An example of added error handling is in the loadBids function. This loads a file and uses the csv module to parse that file. These options have the possibility to throw errors if something goes wrong. To fix this, the section that could throw errors is wrapped in a try/except block which prints meaningful feedback to the user of what caused the error:
```python
bst = binarySearchTree.BinarySearchTree()
    try:
        with open(csvPath) as csvFile:
            # detects csv dialect and presence of header
            dialect = csv.Sniffer().sniff(csvFile.read(1024))
            csvFile.seek(0)
            headerPresent = csv.Sniffer().has_header(csvFile.read(1024))
            csvFile.seek(0)
            csvReader = csv.reader(csvFile, dialect)
            # check for presence of header
            if not headerPresent:
                raise FileFormatError("No header found in CSV file")
            else:
                rowNumber = 1
                for row in csvReader:
                    if rowNumber == 1:
                        bidIdColumn = row.index('Auction ID')
                        titleColumn = row.index('Auction Title')
                        fundColumn = row.index('Fund')
                        bidAmountColumn = row.index('Winning Bid')
                        rowNumber = rowNumber + 1
                    else:
                        bst.insert(Bid(int(row[bidIdColumn]),
                                       row[titleColumn],
                                       row[fundColumn],
                                       float((row[bidAmountColumn][1:]).replace(',','')))) #strip initial $ sign and convert to float
    except Exception as error:
        print("Error loading file")
        print(f"Error type: {type(error)}")
        print(f"Error message: {error}")
    finally:
        return bst
```

An example of input validation can be seen in the displayMainMenu function which displays the main menu and accepts input which is returned to the main function for further processing. This function will only return the entered input if it is found in a list of acceptable choices, otherwise it tells the user the input was invalid and loops back to the start of the function:
```python
def displayMainMenu() -> int:
    """
    Displays the main menu and returns the user's choice
    
    Returns
    -------
    int
        The user's choice
    """
    choice : str = "0"
    while choice == "0":
        print("Menu:")
        print("  1. Load Bids")
        print("  2. Display All Bids")
        print("  3. Find Bid")
        print("  4. Remove Bid")
        print("  9. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter choice: ")
        
        if choice in ["1", "2", "3", "4", "9"]:
            return int(choice)
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again")
            choice = "0"
```

Lastly, examples of the improved documentation can be seen throughout the code in the inclusion of docstrings to document what a function does to make using this code easier for another developer:
```python
    def search(self, key: Any) -> Any:
        """
        Searches for a key in the BST
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        key : Any
            The key to be searched for in the BST
            
        Returns
        -------
        Any
            The full key if found, otherwise None.
            Allows for returning full key if keys are complex objects
            and search was performed with dummy key containing only
            the attributed used for comparison.
        """
```

While making these improvements, I realized additional areas that could be improved which I worked into the final enhancement. First, the original code was all in one file which was good for the original intent, but splitting portions into separate modules adds further improvements as it better encapsulates related code, makes it easier to read and maintain, and provides for future reuse. On this last point specifically, I realized that since I will be adding a red-black tree to the second enhancement, if I split the BST and node classes into their own module, I can add the red-black tree to that and use the code for loading a file and displaying the menu almost unchanged. Next, I incorporated the use of unit testing. I created separate files which test the functionality of the main modules. This greatly speeds up the testing process.

### Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
I planned to target outcomes 1, 4, and 5 with this enhancement and have met all three with the enhancements I made to this artifact. For outcome 1, I have included well written comments and docstrings throughout the code to convey to another developer what functions are for. For outcome 4, I have successfully implemented and used modules that others have created to create my solution. Lastly, for outcome 5, I have added increased security and reliability through data validation and exception handling.

### Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
In addition to the stated learning goals above (i.e., more practice with Python and DSA), I learned a few additional things. First, I chose to better use unit testing while creating this artifact which historically is something I havenâ€™t done much. While it did take time to learn unit testing in Python and develop those unit tests prior to coding the enhancement, it did produce better results and helped to guide my development. Next, I learned that Python has a limit to the number of recursive functions that can be added to the stack which appears to be around 1000. I originally made my BST functions use recursion, but found that when loading a 12,000-line, presorted CSV file, the code would fail due to this limit. Converting the functions to iterative versions solved this issue. Lastly, I learned that the format of a source file can have drastic changes to the functioning code. Once I fixed the issue with recursion, I decided to test my code on the same CSV file but when it was randomly sorted. The presorted file took my program about 13.5 seconds to load while the randomly sorted file took about 0.1 seconds to load. I believe this is because the presorted build an incredibly tall BST (all nodes essentially having only right children) while the randomly sorted file created a more well-balanced BST. This cut down on the iterations during the insertions which created a faster tree.

## Enhancement Two
### Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact chosen for this enhancement is the binary search tree (BST) assignment from CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms. The original intent of this code was to showcase the use of a BST in storing, sorting, searching, displaying, and deleting data that was imported from a CSV file. It was one of a series of similar assignments that accomplished the same task but with different data structures so we could learn firsthand how they function and differ from one another.

### Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?
I chose this artifact for this enhancement due to some discoveries I made while researching data structures and algorithms. I was aware that more advanced data structures existed but I didnâ€™t know much about them, so I had assumed that BST offered what they did with minimal downsides. I quickly discovered that standard BSTs are not guaranteed to have a time complexity of O(log n) because they have no mechanism for enforcing balance to the tree. In fact, in a BST that has no balance (i.e., all nodes share the same parity in regard to their left verse right child status), operations approach a time complexity of O(n) [GeeksforGeeks, 2025](#references). I further learned that BST data structures that enforce self-balancing retain a guaranteed time complexity of O(log n). Based on this, I became interested exploring one of these.

Using this artifact seemed like the obvious choice since it is originally built with a standard BST and improving it with a self-balancing BST would provide me the opportunity to learn how these work while seeing firsthand how they improve upon a non-self-balancing BST. I settled on implementing a Red Black Tree (RBT) over other self-balancing BSTs (i.e., AVL Trees or Splay Trees) because RBTs are best for situations in which insertion speed is needed more than search speed [GeeksforGeeks, 2023](#references). Since this artifact does more insertions than searches, an RBT was chosen as the best option.

The main improvements for this artifact are the inclusion of an RBT as the data structure used while also building it in a way that the BST that was built for enhancement one didnâ€™t break. This was done through separate classes (BST vs RBT) while also modifying the Node class to work with either data structure. In addition to this, I further improved the unit testing to test the new RBT.

The skill I have shown with this enhancement is my ability to select and apply advanced algorithms and data structures to a problem when necessary. The thought process for choosing an RBT over another self-balancing BST shows that I can critically think about the best solution for the task at hand and my coding of the RBT shows that I am able to implement that solution.

### Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
I planned to apply outcomes 1 and 3 with this enhancement. Like enhancement one, I have made significant progress toward outcome 1 with this enhancement through my inclusion of well written comments and docstrings, though I do not wish to consider it completed until finishing enhancement three since I have also applied outcome 1 to that as well. I have successfully completed outcome 3 with this enhancement though my implementation of an RBT as the data structure for this artifact.

### Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
I learned two major things about advanced data structures and algorithms with this enhancement. First is how much more complex they are than the ones we learned in CS-300 Algorithms and Data Structures. I assumed RBTs to be more complex than standard BSTs, but I didnâ€™t realize by how much until I researched them and began to code one. I ran into a few difficulties while coding this RBT which caused it to not work correctly at first. My issue was that I assumed that leaves on an RBT function the same way that they do in a BST, that is that a BSTs leaves are the end of a BST, and their left and right children are null pointers. I originally built the RBT the same without realizing that their leaves have left and right children that are not null pointers but are in fact nodes that have a null key. This seemed like a very minor distinction until my code ran into issues with finding some nodesâ€™ sibling and uncle nodes. In my first iteration, these didnâ€™t always exist, so my code failed. Once I realized this and fixed the issue, the code worked as intended.

The second major thing I learned is how much of an improvement an RBT is over a standard BST. While testing my code, I used two separate data sets for loading information into the data structures. Both had identical information, but one was randomly sorted while the other was sorted by key. With a BST, the randomly sorted data was inserted into the tree quickly (approximately 0.9 seconds) while the sorted data set took significantly longer (about 13.5 seconds). Using the same data sets on an RBT resulted in a load time of about 0.9 seconds for either sorting method. Enforcing balancing to a tree has a significant improvement to its functionality.
